If you open profile-personal.html :

You see height and weight.

We want this in a slider.

So new line

Height
[single range slider]

Weight
[single range slider]

With languages we need a multiple checkbox. So you can click multiple languages. MD Bootstrap covers this.

We use MD Bootstrap. It's important to use the MD Bootstrap. Don't use external scripts if MD bootstrap can cover it. We have the PRO version. So single range slidre + multiple checkbox = MD Bootstrap.
